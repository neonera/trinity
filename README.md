Bowling software for the 21st century

## Usage

There are two modes: `user` and `tv`, for the user touchscreen and the TV view respectfully.

Here are the keybinds for the app:  
`u` - set screen to "user"  
`t` - set screen to "tv"  
`b` - bowl completely random pins  
`[any number]` - If you haven't started a game, this sets how many bowlers. Otherwise, this will bowl the given number of pins.
`/` - make the score of the current frame equal 10 (it creates a **spare** or a **strike**)  
`i` - advance game at an interval (the two scores of the last frame bowled placed next to each other and multiplied by 100 is the interval in ms)

Obviously I can't connect it to a real bowling alley, so these complicated keybinds are all I have for demos and testing.
