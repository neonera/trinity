# Trinity

Bowling software for the 21st century

## Usage

1. Run Trinity development server and Trinity backend server on the same computer
2. Open three browser tabs to the development server for each mode
3. On the Admin screen, start a session on Lane 1 (default for user and TV modes)
4. On the User screen, enter bowler names and start game
5. After 10 seconds, the software will bowl a random amount of pins every .1 seconds

Obviously I can't connect it to a real bowling alley, so this complicated setup is all I have for demos and testing.
